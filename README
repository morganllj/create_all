Get a list of users from an ldap directory and insert them into a distribution list in Zimbra.  Conceived to generate a daily 'all' alias on an automatically provisioned system as a manually populated distribution list would be stale almost instantly.

Minimizes time the alias is unavailable by creating a temporary alias
and then renaming it to the name of the production alias.

- an arbitrary search is used to define the contents of the
  distribution list
- allows a list of exceptions that will be added to the list

TODO:
- there are a number of sub prototypes at the top that I believe are
  from a different script.  They should be removed
- rename script?  It's not just for an 'all' dist list but a general
  dist list creation tool.
