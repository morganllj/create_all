create_all.pl
Morgan Jones (morgan@morganjones.org)

Uses Zimbra's perl SOAP api to get a list of users via an arbitrary
query and create a distribution list.  Initially conceived to generate a daily 'all' alias on an automatically provisioned system as a manually populated distribution list would be stale almost instantly.

Minimizes time the alias is unavailable by creating a temporarly alias
and then renaming it to the name of the production alias.

- accounts can be omitted by CoS
- an arbitrary search is used to define the contents of the
  distribution list
- allows a list of exceptions that will be added to the list
- intelligent about handling account.TOO_MANY_SEARCH_RESULTS error
  that is common if your search returns a large subset

TODO:
- there are a number of sub prototypes at the top that I believe are
  from a different script.  They should be removed
- break configuration into a separate file
- rename script: it's not just for an 'all' dist list but a general
  dist list creation tool.
